# Introduction to Cloud

**In simple terms, Cloud is a Datacenter that is not owned by you but you can rent it and deploy your own services there and they are accessible and manageable over the internet.**

A brief definition of the Cloud looks like this
The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies do not have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.

Companies that provide Cloud Services are called `Cloud Service Providers` and `CSPs` in short i.e `Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud`, etc. further reading [What is Cloud](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-the-cloud/).

## Why Cloud
Cloud is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider.

Cloud helps small organizations to deploy their services at low cost and they don't need to hire employees to maintain physical servers and their networking component. All that things are managed by the cloud provider. further reading

## Advantages
Cloud Provide Us with many advantages. We talk about some of the above but some of them are following.

- **Agility**
	Cloud gives us a faster way of deploying services that take weeks and months to deploy on physical data centers. We can quickly spin up servers, databases, and storage on the cloud and start our work.

- **Elasticity**
	You can easily scale your infrastructure as your business increase and quickly shrink the infrastructure as your business needs changed.

- **Cost Savings**
	Cloud has fixed rates for their services and you only have to pay for the services you use or consume. Unlike Physical Data Centers where their rates are variable and always changing over time.

- **Globally Deployable**
	With the use of the cloud, you can deploy your services globally in minutes and you can also deploy them privately.

## Disadvantages
Above we talk about Cloud Advantages but you should keep its disadvantages in mind also.
- Cloud depends on the **Internet connection** if you have an internet connection you are good to go but if you don't then you cannot access it.
- Cloud is often cited with **Downtime**. At that time you cannot use any cloud services.
- Cloud gives you very **Limited Control and Flexibility**. As Cloud Server is not owned by us so we don't have much control over our services.
- Cloud makes some **Security and Privacy** Concerns as we don't have much control and visibility in the Cloud.
- Cloud is so **Vulnerable to Attacks** as they are globally accessible and there is not much visibility. Companies find themself more vulnerable to attacks and hard to eradicate and Recover from them.

We can tackle and overcome all of the above disadvantages with Cloud best practices. We always have to keep up with the latest cloud best practices and security precautions/practices to keep our cloud secure and beneficial.  

## Cloud Models
Cloud Provides three main types of models. These are the following.
- **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)**: In this model, a company rents the servers and storage they need from a cloud provider. They then use that cloud infrastructure to build their applications. [IaaS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-iaas/) is like a company leasing a plot of land on which they can build whatever they want — but they need to provide their own building equipment and materials. IaaS providers include DigitalOcean, Google Compute Engine, and OpenStack.
- **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)**: In this model, companies don't pay for hosted applications; instead they pay for the things they need to build their own applications. [PaaS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/glossary/platform-as-a-service-paas/) vendors offer everything necessary for building an application, including development tools, infrastructure, and operating systems, over the Internet. PaaS can be compared to renting all the tools and equipment necessary for building a house, instead of renting the house itself. PaaS examples include Heroku and Microsoft Azure.
- **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)**: Instead of users installing an application on their device, [SaaS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-saas/) applications are hosted on cloud servers, and users access them over the Internet. SaaS is like renting a house: the landlord maintains the house, but the tenant mostly gets to use it as if they owned it. Examples of SaaS applications include Salesforce, MailChimp, and Slack.

Above are the main Models but today's cloud model adds some more things there i.e **Function-as-a-service (FaaS)** and more. That is out of scope but I recommend you take your own research on it.

## Cloud Deployments
Above we talk about Cloud Models in which we know what services the cloud offers but now we talk about Cloud Deployments in which we know who manages them and where they are.
The most common cloud Deployments are the following.
- **Public Cloud**: This is a data center managed by a Cloud Service Provider, such as AWS, Azure, GCP, or OCI. The public cloud is a shared infrastructure running thousands of clients. While this allows CSPs to get their services to the most amount of people, this can also open up potential security concerns.
- **Private Cloud**: _Private cloud_ (also known as an internal cloud or corporate cloud) is a [cloud computing](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/cloud-computing) environment in which all hardware and software resources are dedicated exclusively to, and accessible only by, a single customer. Private cloud combines many of the benefits of cloud computing—including elasticity, scalability, and ease of service delivery—with the access control, security, and resource customization of [on-premises infrastructure](https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/solutions/hybrid-cloud).
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Hybrid cloud integrates public cloud services, private cloud services, and on-premises infrastructure and provides orchestration, management, and application portability across all three. The result is a single, unified, and flexible distributed computing environment where an organization can run and scale its traditional or cloud-native workloads on the most appropriate computing model.

> **Note**: Hybrid Cloud term is deprecated and Now it become Multi-Cloud

- **Multi-Cloud**: Multicloud is a cloud computing deployment model that enables organizations to deliver application services across multiple private and public clouds containing some or any combination of the following: multiple cloud vendors, multiple cloud accounts, multiple cloud availability zones, or multiple cloud regions or premises.

There we just scratch the surface and give a very small introduction about the cloud. Cloud is a big topic and to fully explain that we have to do more research and I recommend you to do that.
